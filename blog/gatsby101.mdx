Gatsby is a React based framework for static fast-rendering React websites and apps.
It has a lot of ready-to-use templates and it uses GraphQL for data retrieving and connection to the database.
It has a lot of plugings to shortcut the coding proccess of the website and allows integrations to many of the popular libraries for CMS, CSS design and analytics.
