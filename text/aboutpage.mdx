After a successful career in Finance, I’ve decided to pursue a new challenge as a software developer.
I’m highly auto didactic with great passion for software and innovation.
I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills and excellent interpersonal skills.
The “can do” approach is my way of life. I believe that my unique background in the Fintech industry has a special added value.
I am looking for a full-time job.
