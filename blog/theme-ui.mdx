Gatsby is a React based framework that allows developers to quickly build static websites and apps.
ThemeUI is a styling library that allows developers to configure designs for their components by giving them predefined values in a shared theme object.
This concept is called a constraint based design principles - a template for configurable, reusable styles that will help to build a styling system for your project.
You can install it as a plugin to your Gatsby project really quickly by following the instructions in the Gatsby docs.
Theme object: a file with all the shared design specifications that will be applied in all the project pages. You can also use preset theme design.
You can access the styles in your Theme object by using the sx props in components or by using the jsx pragma that replace a React.createElement with a custom createElement function that applies the Theme object style values:

/** @jsx jsx */
import {jsx} from 'theme-ui'
export default props => (
    <div 
        {...props}
        sx={{
            //values referencing scales defined in a theme object
            color: 'primary',
            bg: 'lightgray',
            fontFamily: 'body'.
            //raw CSS values
            boxShadow: ' 0 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .125)',
        }}
    />
)

example for basic level:

Theme color object file:
colors: {
    text: "white",
    background: "#fff",
    primary: "rebeccapurple",
    secondary: "coral",
},

sx props in components:
<div sx={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <Square sx={{ backgroundColor: "primary" }}>Primary</Square>
    <Square sx={{ backgroundColor: "secondary" }}>Scondary</Square>
</div>

Variants: allows you to define variations of styles for common components like buttons.

//example theme with Variants
{
    colors: {
        primary: '#07c',
        swcondary: '#639',
    },
    buttons: {
        primary: {
            color: 'white',
            bg: 'primary',
        },
        secondary: {
            color: 'white',
            bg: 'secondary',
        },
    },
}

<button sx={{ variant: 'buttons.primary' }} />

Breakpoints: media queries are defined by values given in an array.

//example:
{
    breakpoints: [
        '40em', '56em', '64em',
    ],
}

Color modes: allows you to create different color modes such as dark mode.

[] Theme objects are where your style values for your entire application live.
[] Custom tool that will build out your theme object for you to copy and paste.
[] Remember to add and import your jsx pragma and use the sx prop to access your styles.
[] Theme UI comes with tons of cool features such as variants, breakpoints, color modes, and more.
